![ ](Images/Analytics5.gif?raw=true "Title")

#### Are you interested in converting data into insightful information? Are you struggling with large dataset? Do you want to merge multiple sources of data and create powerful tables and charts? Do you want to create (automated) reports with professional graphs and maps? 

### These are few examples of visualization using R! 

--------------------------------------------------

[1-Mobility and Transportation](https://github.com/Selimach/visualization/tree/master/Mobility%20and%20Transportation)

#### Urban transport

a - Descriptive statistics of the french urban transport network, based on a set of data available online (source: RATP).  This type of reports can be automatically generated and updated for example each month.

b - Analysis of mobility trends in 11 European cities since March 2020. Creation of a multidimensional map to benchmark cities.

c - Analysis of the road accidents in Geneva by displaying information on a map showing the location of occurrence. The last multidimensional graph shows accidents split by meteorological conditions. 

#### Air transport 

a - Display of the number of daily flights in Europe since Jan 2019 (data sourced from Eurocontrol). It is another example of a clear visualization that can be obtained with ggplot2 library.

b - Creation of a complex multiple charts showing the number of daily flights by country.

c - Creation of various charts to benchmark airlines on various routes.

[2- Socio-economic](https://github.com/Selimach/visualization/tree/master/Socio-economic)

Creation of several maps showing economic data (e.g. employment rates per country in Europe, Swiss population and GDP per canton). 

[3- Consumer goods](https://github.com/Selimach/visualization/tree/master/Consumer%20goods)

a - Chart showing the number of calories by menu and restaurant or how to transform data from a rough table into a more insightful representation. 

[4- Finance](https://github.com/Selimach/visualization/tree/master/Finance)

a - High-frequency charts of daily SMI (Swiss Market Index), with the possibility of combining several charts. The second part is an attempt to run some predictions. For those interested by time series and forecasting, I can recommand [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3) by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos

[5- Real Estate](https://github.com/Selimach/visualization/tree/master/Real%20Estate)

a- Overview of the real estate market in Nyon (Switzerland). The report is updated on a regular basis using the features of the Rmarkdown.
