#### Are you interested in converting data into valuable information ? Are you struggling with data manipulation in Excel ? Do you want to merge multiple sources of data and create powerful tables ? Do you want to create automated reports with professional graphs and maps ? 

### These are few examples of visualization using R! I used for these examples the layout of "The Economist" magazine.

--------------------------------------------------

#### 1 - Urban transport
#### Descriptive statistics of the french urban transport network, based on a set of data available online (source: RATP). This is an example of a type of analysis that can be performed easily using R. This type of reports can be automated and produced every month for example (cf. Analyse_Urban_Traffic_Sample).

#### 2 - Air transport data 
#### Display of the number of daily flights operated within European airports since Jan 2019 (data sourced from Euro control). It is another example of a clear visualization that can be obtained with plotting 2 library (cf. Airport_Daily_Traffic.pg).

#### 3 - Air transport data 
#### Creation of a complex chart showing the number of daily flights for each Euro control member states (Daily_Traffic_By_State.pg, associated code available in airport.Rd).

#### 4 - Employment rates in Europe
#### Display of a chart showing the evolution of employment rates per country (with only few countries highlighted) based on data sourced from Euro stat.  Display of information on a map. A pd can be generated to display this information and the code can be hidden for non-technical audience (cf. cartography.pd). 

#### 5 - Fast food restaurants
#### Display of a chart showing the number of calories by menu and restaurant (cf. restaurant.pdf) or how to transform data in a table into a more insightful representation.
