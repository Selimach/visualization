#### Are you interested in converting data into valuable information ? Are you struggling with manipulating data in Excel ?  Do you want to merge multiple sources of data and create tables ? Do you want to create automated reports with professional graphs and maps ? I used for these examples the layout of "The Economist" magazine

### These are few examples of visualization using R!
--------------------------------------------------

1 - Descriptive statistics of the french urban transport network, based on a set of data available online (source: RATP). This is an example of the type of analysis that can be performed easily using R (data manipulation and extraction graphics with ggplot2, cartography.) This type of reports can be automated and produced every month for example (cf. Analyse_Urban_Traffic_Sample).

2 - Airport daily traffic: this graph shows the number of flights operating in European airport since Jan 2019 (data sourced from Eurocontrol). This another example of a nice visualization than can be obtained with ggplot 2 library (cf. Airport_Daily_Traffic.png).

3 - Creation of a complex chart showing the number of daily flights for each Eurocontrol member states using wrap techniques (Daily_Traffic_By_State.png, associated code available in airport.Rmd)

4 - Loading and processing data from Eurostat on employment rates. Display of a chart showing the evolution of employment rates per country (top 5 countries highlighted), and the same information on a mapcf. cartography).
