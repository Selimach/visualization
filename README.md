#### Are you interested in converting data into valuable information ? Are you struggling with data manipulation in Excel ? Do you want to merge multiple sources of data and create powerful tables ? Do you want to create automated reports with professional graphs and maps ? 

### These are few examples of visualization using R! I used for these examples the layout of "The Economist" magazine.

--------------------------------------------------

1 - Descriptive statistics of the french urban transport network, based on a set of data available online (source: RATP). This is an example of the type of analysis that can be performed easily using R. This type of reports can be automated and produced every month (cf. Analyse_Urban_Traffic_Sample).

2 - Airport daily traffic: this graph shows the number of flights operated within European airports since Jan 2019 (data sourced from Eurocontrol). It is another example of a clear visualization that can be obtained with ggplot 2 library (cf. Airport_Daily_Traffic.png).

3 - Creation of a complex chart showing the number of daily flights for each Eurocontrol member states (Daily_Traffic_By_State.png, associated code available in airport.Rmd).

4 - Display of a chart showing the evolution of employment rates per country (with only few countries highlighted) based on data sourced from Eurostat.  Display of information on a map. A pdf can be generated to display this information and the code can be hidden for non-technical audience (cf. cartography.pdf).
