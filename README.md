## The objective of this page is to show few examples of visualization produced using R capabilities

#### Descriptive statistics of the french urban transport netowrk, based on a set of data available online (source: RATP). This is an example of the type of analysis that can be performed easly using R (data manipulation and extraction graphics with ggplot2, cartograhy.)

#### Airport daily traffic: this graph shows the number of flights operating in European airport since Jan 2019 (data sourced from Eurocontrol). This another example of a nice visualozation than can be obtained with ggplot 2 library.
