#### Are you interested in converting data into valuable information ? Are you struggling with manipulating data in Excel ?  Do you want to merge multiple sources of data and create tables ? Do you want to create automated reports with professional graphs and maps ? 

### These are few examples of visualization using R!
--------------------------------------------------

1 - Descriptive statistics of the french urban transport netowrk, based on a set of data available online (source: RATP). This is an example of the type of analysis that can be performed easly using R (data manipulation and extraction graphics with ggplot2, cartograhy.) This type of reports can be automated and produced every month for example.

2 - Airport daily traffic: this graph shows the number of flights operating in European airport since Jan 2019 (data sourced from Eurocontrol). This another example of a nice visualozation than can be obtained with ggplot 2 library.
