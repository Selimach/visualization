# The objective of this page is to show few examples of visualization that I produced using R capabilities

### Network visualisation: the objective of this exercise is to show graphically links between two set of entities, the first one being service providers and the second one are clients. For this exercise, we are using data, in a table format, sourced from the EU TED database available online. This is an example of how tabular information can be translated graphically.

### Descriptive statistics of the french urban transport netowrk, based on a set of data available online (source: RATP). This is an example of the type of analysis that can be performed easly using R (data manipulation and extraction graphics with ggplot2, cartograhy.)

### Airport daily traffic: this graph shows the number of flights operating in European airport since Jan 2019 (data sourced from Eurocontrol). This another example of a nice visualozation than can be obtained with ggplot 2 library.
